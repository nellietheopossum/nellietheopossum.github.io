<center><p> Nellie is very hungry. <br> After a long night of searching, she discovers an overturned trash can and digs around in it. <br> She finds some delicious grapes. </p></center>

<center><p> By the time she finishes eating her grapes, it is morning. <br> Time for bed! <br> Nellie curls up inside an abandoned mattress and goes to sleep.</p></center>

<center><p> A DOG!!! <br> Nellie hisses ferociously, furious that he has discovered her. </p></center>

<center><image src=image/possum.jpg alt="possum" class="image5"></image>

<center><p> Terrified, the dog slinks away. <br> He is no match for Nellie.</p></center>

<center><p> Nellie is relieved. <br> She continues on her journey... </P>

<center><h3> *TWO MONTHS LATER*</h3><center>
<center><p> Surprise!!! <center><p>
<center><image src=image/babies.jpg alt="babies" class="image9"></image>
<center><p> Nellie had babies! <br> Sadly, most of these babies will not survive to adulthood. <br> But the ones that do will grow up to be just like Nellie. </p></center>

	<center><p> Before Nellie knows it, her babies are having adventures of their own! </p></center>
